\begin{abstract}
{\it In various applications in nuclear engineering and in particular in test reactors, heat removal is carried by single-phase axial flow. In these applications, we observe sharp changes in molecular viscosity while the density presents very limited changes. As a consequence, the Reynolds number increases often by 2-3 folds across the channel, with an inlet value often transitional.  In these conditions, turbulence changes significantly across the length of the channel with redistribution and thinning of the boundary layers. This is different from acceleration as the effect of changes in density is negligible. We aim to characterize in detail this phenomenon. 

In particular Nek5000, a spectral-element computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, will be used to perform DNS of fluid flow in the transition regime for channel flow with varying viscosity.  We set up a novel benchmark case: the channel is extended in the stream-wise direction up to 20pi. The viscosity is kept constant in the first 4pi region. This inlet region is used as a cyclic region to obtain a fully developed flow profile at the beginning of the ramping region. The ramping region (4pi -20pi) is defined as a transition region where the viscosity is linearly decreased along the channel. The flow is homogenous in the span-wise direction due to the periodic boundary conditions. Due to the cyclic and wall boundary conditions, the flow is non-homogenous in the stream-wise and wall-normal direction respectively.

In this study, specific focus is given to the investigation of turbulence properties and structures in the near-wall region along the flow direction. Detailed turbulence budgets are collected and investigated. As expected, the results show that variation in the Reynolds across a channel does not cause an immediate change in the size of turbulent structures in the ramp region and a delay is in fact observed. Moreover, the results from the present study are compared with a correlation available in the literature for the friction velocity and as a function of the Reynolds-number.}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

The turbulence channel simulated is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:geometries}. In this figure, regions I, II and III are defined by two planes crossing the channel. In this problem, the viscosity is a function of the streamwise distance, expressed here by the spatial variable \(x\). This parameter has constants values of \(1E-4\) Pa.s and \(5E-5\) Pa.s along regions I and III respectively, while in region II it decreases with respect to the inverse of \(x\).

For the present work, three cases varying the length of region II are studied. Cases I, II and III have their region II begining at \(x=4\pi\) and the length of region II are respectively \(16\pi\), \(8\pi\) and \(4\pi\). Fig.~\ref{fig:viscosity_cases} shows the plot of the viscosity as a function of \(x\) for each one of these cases. For all cases the inleat flow in region I is considered to be fully developed with \(Re_{\tau}=550\), i.e., the same conditions as in \cite{hoyas2008}, while a periodic condition is considered for the boundaries of the spamwise direction, i.e., \(z\) axis, and finally wall conditions are considered for the boudaries of the vertical direction, i.e., \(y\) axis.

\section*{METHODS}

In order to resolve the finest turbulent scales, the calculations of this work has been developed through Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). To do so, a spectral element code Nek5000 was employed, where this code has been developed in Argonne National aboratory (ANL) and it has been validated in references \cite{merzari2013} and \cite{Obabko2011}.

The solution of this method is given by trigonometric series, in each element a polynomial functions of up to the twelveth degree have been employed to discretize the velocity field. Fig.~\ref{fig:cross_grid} shows an example of the grid from half of the channel's cross section. One should notice that the discretization presented by this particular area is identical through all model's domain and it is only presented half of the cross-section for better visualization of the frame.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{center}
  \caption{THE GRID EMPLOYED IN THE STREAMWISE-DIRECTION CROSS SECTION OF THE TUBULENCE CHANNEL.}
  \label{fig:cross_grid}
\end{figure}

DNS simulations are able to simulate the finest turbulent length scales without using any turbulent model. Since the present work is focused on studying the contribution of the smaller scales to the energy cascade, it is required to use DNS rather than Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) or Large Eddy Simulations (LES), although there is a substantial growth of the computational cost.

\section*{RESULTS}

The results from the three cases considered in this work are presented in this section. First, the friction Reynolds number variation along the streamwise direction \(x\) of the channels are computed and compared with an expression for \(Re_{\tau}\) as a function of the Reynolds number existed in Ref.~\cite{pope}. This analysis shows the fact that the predicted shift in the friction Reynolds number due to a viscosity change imposed through region II is not immediate. Thereon, Reynolds stresses are collected and turbulent structures are investigated along the simulated channels.

\section*{USE OF SI UNITS}

An ASME paper should use SI units.  When preference is given to SI units, the U.S. customary units may be given in parentheses or omitted. When U.S. customary units are given preference, the SI equivalent {\em shall} be provided in parentheses or in a supplementary table. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{MATHEMATICS}

Equations should be numbered consecutively beginning with (1) to the end of the paper, including any appendices.  The number should be enclosed in parentheses and set flush right in the column on the same line as the equation.  An extra line of space should be left above and below a displayed equation or formula. \LaTeX\ can automatically keep track of equation numbers in the paper and format almost any equation imaginable. An example is shown in Eqn.~(\ref{eq_ASME}). The number of a referenced equation in the text should be preceded by Eqn.\ unless the reference starts a sentence in which case Eqn.\ should be expanded to Equation.

\begin{equation}
f(t) = \int_{0_+}^t F(t) dt + \frac{d g(t)}{d t}
\label{eq_ASME}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{FIGURES AND TABLES}

All figures should be positioned at the top of the page where possible.  All figures should be numbered consecutively and captioned; the caption uses all capital letters, and centered under the figure as shown in Fig.~\ref{figure_ASME}. All text within the figure should be no smaller than 7~pt. There should be a minimum two line spaces between figures and text. The number of a referenced figure or table in the text should be preceded by Fig.\ or Tab.\ respectively unless the reference starts a sentence in which case Fig.\ or Tab.\ should be expanded to Figure or Table.

\section*{FOOTNOTES\protect\footnotemark}
\footnotetext{Examine the input file, asme2e.tex, to see how a footnote is given in a head.}

Footnotes are referenced with superscript numerals and are numbered consecutively from 1 to the end of the paper\footnote{Avoid footnotes if at all possible.}. Footnotes should appear at the bottom of the column in which they are referenced.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{CITING REFERENCES}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The ASME reference format is defined in the authors kit provided by the ASME.  The format is:

\begin{quotation}
{\em Text Citation}. Within the text, references should be cited in  numerical order according to their order of appearance.  The numbered reference citation should be enclosed in brackets.
\end{quotation}

The references must appear in the paper in the order that they were cited.  In addition, multiple citations (3 or more in the same brackets) must appear as a `` [1-3]''.  A complete definition of the ASME reference format can be found in the  ASME manual \cite{asmemanual}.

The bibliography style required by the ASME is unsorted with entries appearing in the order in which the citations appear. If that were the only specification, the standard {\sc Bib}\TeX\ unsrt bibliography style could be used. Unfortunately, the bibliography style required by the ASME has additional requirements (last name followed by first name, periodical volume in boldface, periodical number inside parentheses, etc.) that are not part of the unsrt style. Therefore, to get ASME bibliography formatting, you must use the \verb+asmems4.bst+ bibliography style file with {\sc Bib}\TeX. This file is not part of the standard BibTeX distribution so you'll need to place the file someplace where LaTeX can find it (one possibility is in the same location as the file being typeset).

With \LaTeX/{\sc Bib}\TeX, \LaTeX\ uses the citation format set by the class file and writes the citation information into the .aux file associated with the \LaTeX\ source. {\sc Bib}\TeX\ reads the .aux file and matches the citations to the entries in the bibliographic data base file specified in the \LaTeX\ source file by the \verb+\bibliography+ command. {\sc Bib}\TeX\ then writes the bibliography in accordance with the rules in the bibliography .bst style file to a .bbl file which \LaTeX\ merges with the source text.  A good description of the use of {\sc Bib}\TeX\ can be found in \cite{latex, goosens} (see how 2 references are handled?).  The following is an example of how three or more references \cite{latex, asmemanual,  goosens} show up using the \verb+asmems4.bst+ bibliography style file in conjunction with the \verb+asme2e.cls+ class file. Here are some more \cite{art, blt, ibk, icn, ips, mts, mis, pro, pts, trt, upd} which can be used to describe almost any sort of reference.

% Here's where you specify the bibliography style file.
% The full file name for the bibliography style file 
% used for an ASME paper is asmems4.bst.
